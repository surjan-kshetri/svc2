1. System description

a. What it does (functionality)

Node.js web app – ???

b. How it is built (technologies)

Google Cloud Platform - was for Shell scripting

GitHub – used as a repository

Docker – used to containerize the app

c. How to build, deploy, and run it 1. Fork the svc2 from DM academy to GitHub repository

2. Clone that repository to GCP

3. Using the docker file we containerized the image

4. Push it to Docker hub (pub.sh)

2. Your team journey a. Semester

Spring 2019 – SEIS 664 Information technology Delivery

b. Team names (last name initial if you want).

Surjan K., Samra S., Sharifah

c. Issues, breakthroughs, lessons learned (this section is MAJOR)

Issues: Understanding the shell scripting was hard.

Breakthroughs: we didn’t encounter a lot in the whole process. But when we recreated the diagram of the whole process of what each team is trying to accomplish, that architecture diagram was at least a starting point to help us understand how we need to move forward and maneuver the project. (diagram attached below).

Lessons: Team support & coordination is very necessary when you’re in a completely foreign terrain. Learned how to communicate difficult questions and navigate the experience of finding answers together.

d. Current status of the application - what needs to be done next.

Successfully build the docker image and pushed it to GCP. To a point where the deployment team should be able to work with it on Kubernete
